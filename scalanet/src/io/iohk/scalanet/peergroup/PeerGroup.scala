  * An example channel is a TCP connection.
  *
  * Channel implementations should in general be multiplexed. This means they have the
  * property that two distinct channels represent distinct streams of
  * messages. A message sent down one channel should not cross over into another.

  * A PeerGroup instance represents a node's view of a group of peers that can share data.
  * Concrete instances represent concrete network protocols. This can be internet protocols
  * such as TCP and UDP or higher-level peer-to-peer protocols.
  *
  * Depending on the implementation, peer groups may implement quite complex discovery, enrolment,
  * routing, encryption, relaying, etc. Alternatively, they might call directly into an existing
  * protocol stack provided by the JVM or OS. In either case, they still providing the same messaging
  * interface to calling code. Thus, while the messaging is consistent, there is expected to be a lot
  * of heterogeneity in the configuration of peer groups.
  *
  * @tparam A the address type. This type is completely arbitrary and left to peer group implementers.
  *           For an internet protocol it may be some kind of socket address (such as InetSocketAddress)
  *           or for a p2p protocols it might be a nodeId or public key hash.
  * @tparam M the message type. Currently, each peer group instance represents a single message
  *           type (or base trait). Multiple protocols, represented as multiple base traits
  *           are not yet supported, though expect this soonish.
